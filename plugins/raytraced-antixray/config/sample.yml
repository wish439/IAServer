# The delay to start raytracing after the player joins the server / teleport / world change.
raytraceDelay: 10
# The trusted block range when player joins the server / teleport / world change.
# Trust range is basically any block within the range will not be checked for raytracing.
# This is useful to make sure whenever teleported, the nearby blocks will seems normal.

# Should the newly placed block in loaded chunks be raytraced?
# The term 'loaded chunk' means the chunk that is loaded by the player's client.
# Not the server's chunk loading.
# This feature is useful to prevent the player from using x-ray by another player's block placement.
# However, this feature will be a bit more resource-intensive.
tracePlacedBlock: true
# Should the block group be enabled?
# The block group is a feature that will group the blocks that are connected to each other.
# And raytrace the group instead of the individual block.
blockGrouping: false
# Should stop raytracing the block when the player reveals it?
revealStopRaytracing: false
# Should the block check be aggressive?
# If enabled, the block will be checked every time the block is attempting an update.
# This feature is useful

# The blocks to be obfuscated.
# For regular minecraft blocks, you can use the XMaterial enum.
# Which is listed here: https://github.com/CryptoMorin/XSeries/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cryptomorin/xseries/XMaterial.java#L68
# If your server is modded and the material is not in the XMaterial, you can use the bukkit material name instead.
# For modern versions (1.13+), you can use the block registry name for more detailed specification & modded block info that isn't in XMaterial dictionary,
# Example: 'minecraft:stone_stairs[waterlogged=true]'.

# For ItemsAdder custom blocks, you can use the format 'ia:custom_block_registry_name'.
# For Oraxen custom blocks, you can use the format 'oraxen:custom_item_registry_name'.
# For Nexo custom blocks, you can use the format 'nexo:custom_item_registry_name'.
