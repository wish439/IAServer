# Settings for when the server-sent hashed seed is randomized.
randomize_hashed_seed:
  # Whether the seed should be randomized in the login packet.
  # The login packet is sent before the player sees the world, to send server and join world information.
  # This is NOT the handshake login packet, so at this point the player already joined the server.
  login: true
  # Whether the seed should be randomized in the respawn packet.
  # The respawn packet is sent when the player respawns after a death, and when they are teleported to a different dimension.
  # It contains about half the fields the login packet has, mainly the new world information.
  respawn: true

# Warning: All of these actually modify your world. Only enable them if you are okay with that!
modifiers:
  # Modification of end spikes (bedrock) so that they do not conform to known pillar generation seeds.

    # Whether this feature is enabled.
    enabled: false
    # How the end spikes should be modified.
    # "swap" means that it swaps the bedrock blocks of two spikes, but this comes at the downside of floating bedrock.
    # "move" means that it moves a random bedrock block down, but makes the positions "illogical".
    # At the moment there is no check against "move", so by default I recommend "move".

    # The worlds end spikes are allowed to be modified in.

  # Modification of end cities' base tower (magenta_stained_glass -> magenta_stained_glass_pane).
  # This check is only done once per end city; so if someone decides to 'fix' it, the effort is undone.

    # Whether this feature is enabled.
    enabled: false
    # The worlds end cities are allowed to be modified in.
